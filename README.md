Pokedex-App
This is a web app I wrote in Full Stack Development Course at CareerFoundry.

Built with:
HTML, 
CSS, 
JavaScript, 
jQuery, 
Bootstrap.


Description:
The pokedex-app loads data from external Pok√©API and shows details of Pokemons by click in a modal.
The user also can search live for a specific Pokemon.
